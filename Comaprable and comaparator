In Java, both `Comparator` and `comparing` are used to define custom sorting logic, but they serve different purposes:

---

### ✅ **1. `Comparator` Interface**

* **Definition**: It's a functional interface used to define a custom comparison logic between two objects.
* **Syntax**:

  ```java
  Comparator<Employee> byName = new Comparator<Employee>() {
      public int compare(Employee e1, Employee e2) {
          return e1.getName().compareTo(e2.getName());
      }
  };
  ```
* **Since Java 8**, you can use a lambda:

  ```java
  Comparator<Employee> byName = (e1, e2) -> e1.getName().compareTo(e2.getName());
  ```

---

### ✅ **2. `Comparator.comparing()` Method**

* **Definition**: A **static method** in the `Comparator` interface used to simplify comparator creation based on a key extractor function.
* **Syntax**:

  ```java
  Comparator<Employee> byName = Comparator.comparing(Employee::getName);
  ```
* It's equivalent to writing:

  ```java
  Comparator<Employee> byName = (e1, e2) -> e1.getName().compareTo(e2.getName());
  ```

### ⚖️ **Key Differences**

| Aspect       | `Comparator` Interface              | `Comparator.comparing()`                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Type         | Interface                           | Static method in `Comparator`                   |
| Purpose      | To define custom comparison logic   | To create a comparator based on a key extractor |
| Verbosity    | More verbose, especially pre-Java 8 | More concise and readable                       |
| Java Version | Available since Java 1.2            | Introduced in Java 8 (with lambdas and streams) |

### ✅ Example

```java
List<Employee> list = ...;

// Using Comparator interface (lambda):
list.sort((e1, e2) -> e1.getAge() - e2.getAge());

// Using Comparator.comparing:
list.sort(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getAge));
```

Would you like a visual flowchart to illustrate how `Comparator.comparing()` works internally?
